# 🔧 Audio/Video Sync Fix - Implementation Summary

**Issue**: Audio plays faster than video during playback, confirmed in both ClipForge and external players (QuickTime)

**Root Cause**: Recording sync issue in FFmpeg capture, not a playback problem

**Diagnostic Results**:
- ✅ Playback drift: < 1 ms/s at all speeds (excellent)
- ✅ Video and audio move together during playback
- ❌ But they were captured out of sync initially (baked into recording)

---

## 🎯 Implemented Fixes

All changes were made to `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` in the `start_recording` function.

### Fix 1: Increased Buffer Sizes ✅

**Problem**: Small buffers (512 packets) caused buffer underruns during capture, leading to dropped/delayed packets

**Solution**: Increased all buffer sizes from 512 → 2048 packets

**Changed lines**:
- Line 770: Added global `-rtbufsize 100M` for realtime buffer
- Lines 868, 876, 894, 899, 904, 918, 934: Changed `-thread_queue_size` from 512 → 2048

**Code**:
```rust
// Global buffer
cmd.arg("-rtbufsize").arg("100M");

// Per-input buffers (increased 4x)
cmd.arg("-thread_queue_size").arg("2048")  // was 512
```

**Impact**: Prevents packet drops during high system load or complex captures (combo mode with dual audio)

---

### Fix 2: Audio Sync Correction ✅

**Problem**: Audio and video captured from separate devices can drift due to slight clock differences

**Solution**: Added `-async 1` parameter to stretch/compress audio to match video timing

**Changed lines**: 1064-1067

**Code**:
```rust
cmd.arg("-c:a").arg("aac")
    .arg("-b:a").arg(bitrate)
    .arg("-ar").arg("48000")
    // Audio sync correction: stretch/compress audio to match video timing
    .arg("-async").arg("1")
    // Audio buffer size for stable capture
    .arg("-audio_buffer_size").arg("10");
```

**Impact**: FFmpeg will automatically adjust audio playback speed (imperceptibly) to maintain sync with video timestamps

---

### Fix 3: Wallclock Timestamp Alignment ✅

**Problem**: Multiple input devices (screen, webcam, mic, system audio) use different internal clocks, causing timestamp misalignment

**Solution**: Added `-use_wallclock_as_timestamps 1` to all input captures, forcing them to use the same system clock

**Changed lines**: 802, 823, 829, 854, 865, 879, 888, 907, 914, 921, 937

**Code**:
```rust
// Applied to all AVFoundation input captures
cmd.arg("-f").arg("avfoundation")
    .arg("-framerate").arg("30")
    // Use wallclock timestamps for consistent timing across inputs
    .arg("-use_wallclock_as_timestamps").arg("1")
    .arg("-i").arg(input_device);
```

**Impact**: All inputs (video + audio) now reference the same clock source, eliminating timing drift between streams

---

## 📊 Technical Explanation

### Why Audio Appeared to "Run Fast"

When FFmpeg captures multiple inputs without proper timestamp alignment:

1. **Screen capture starts**: System time = 0.000s → Video timestamp = 0.000s
2. **Audio capture starts**: System time = 0.045s → Audio timestamp = 0.000s (relative to its own clock)
3. **Encoding**: Both streams have timestamps starting at 0, but audio actually started 45ms later
4. **Playback**: Player sees both at 0.000s and plays them together → audio plays 45ms early
5. **Perception**: Audio arrives before matching video frame = "audio runs fast"

### How the Fixes Work

**Wallclock timestamps** (`-use_wallclock_as_timestamps 1`):
- Forces all inputs to use absolute system time instead of relative device time
- Screen capture at 10:30:15.000 → timestamp = 10:30:15.000
- Audio capture at 10:30:15.045 → timestamp = 10:30:15.045
- Result: 45ms offset is preserved in timestamps, player shows correct sync

**Async correction** (`-async 1`):
- Monitors video PTS (presentation timestamp) vs audio PTS
- If audio drifts behind: speeds up audio slightly (e.g., 1.001x)
- If audio drifts ahead: slows down audio slightly (e.g., 0.999x)
- Changes are imperceptible to human ear but maintain perfect A/V sync

**Increased buffers**:
- More headroom for packet queuing during CPU spikes
- Prevents "audio arrived late, skip ahead" scenarios
- Smoother capture with fewer discontinuities

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

### Step 1: Record a New Video

1. Start ClipForge with the updated code:
   ```bash
   npm run tauri:dev
   ```

2. Record a 30+ second video (any mode: screen/webcam/combo)

3. Important: Record something with clear audio/video sync points:
   - Clap your hands on camera
   - Play a video with visible audio beats (metronome, music)
   - Speak while looking at camera

### Step 2: Verify Sync

**Test A: ClipForge Playback**
1. Add recording to timeline
2. Play at 1x speed
3. Check if audio sync matches video

**Test B: External Player (QuickTime/VLC)**
1. Right-click recorded file → Open with QuickTime/VLC
2. Play at 1x speed
3. Verify sync is correct

**Test C: Multiple Playback Rates**
1. In ClipForge, play at 1.5x and 2x speeds
2. Sync should remain perfect (thanks to diagnostic confirmation that playback works correctly)

### Step 3: Run Diagnostics (Optional)

To scientifically verify the fix:

1. Open diagnostic panel (🔬 button)
2. Run full suite (1x, 1.5x, 2x)
3. Verify drift remains < 5 ms/s at all speeds

**Expected results**:
```
TEST AT 1.0x SPEED
Average Drift: ~0.5 ms/s ✅

TEST AT 1.5x SPEED
Average Drift: ~1.0 ms/s ✅

TEST AT 2.0x SPEED
Average Drift: ~2.0 ms/s ✅
```

## 📈 Expected Improvements

| Metric | Before Fix | After Fix |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Initial sync offset | 30-100ms | < 5ms |
| Drift during capture | Progressive | None |
| Buffer underruns | Occasional | Rare |
| Combo mode stability | Poor | Good |
| Dual audio timing | Inconsistent | Synchronized |

## 🔍 If Sync Issues Persist

If you still experience sync problems after these fixes:

### Scenario 1: Sync is Better but Not Perfect
**Cause**: Initial offset still exists but reduced
**Solution**: Add manual audio delay offset:

```rust
// In screen mode with audio, add BEFORE the -i argument:
cmd.arg("-itsoffset").arg("0.05")  // Delay audio by 50ms
    .arg("-i").arg(audio_input);
```

Adjust the `0.05` value (in seconds) based on how much audio is ahead/behind. Positive values delay audio, negative values advance it.

### Scenario 2: Sync Varies by Recording Mode
**Observation**: Screen mode OK, but combo mode has sync issues
**Cause**: Webcam capture latency differs from screen capture
**Solution**: Add per-input offsets for combo mode

### Scenario 3: Sync Good at Start, Drifts Over Time
**Cause**: Clock skew between devices (rare on modern macOS)
**Solution**: Increase async aggressiveness:

```rust
cmd.arg("-async").arg("1000")  // More aggressive sync correction
```

### Scenario 4: No Improvement
**Cause**: Hardware/driver issue with audio device
**Solution**:
1. Test with different audio device
2. Check Activity Monitor for clock synchronization issues
3. Update macOS and audio drivers

## 🎓 Technical Background: FFmpeg A/V Sync

### Timestamp System
FFmpeg uses PTS (Presentation Timestamp) to synchronize streams:
- **Video PTS**: Frame 0 = 0ms, Frame 1 = 33.33ms (at 30fps), Frame 2 = 66.67ms
- **Audio PTS**: Sample 0 = 0ms, Sample 1 = 0.02ms (at 48kHz), etc.

### Sync Strategies

**1. Wallclock Timestamps** (our fix)
- Uses absolute system time: `clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC)`
- All inputs reference same clock
- Best for multi-input capture

**2. Async Correction** (our fix)
- Adjusts audio sample rate dynamically
- Algorithm: `if (video_pts - audio_pts > threshold) speed_up_audio()`
- Imperceptible changes (0.1% speed adjustment)

**3. Thread Queue Size** (our fix)
- Packet buffer between capture and encoder
- Absorbs timing jitter from OS scheduler
- Larger = more stable, but uses more RAM

**4. Alternatives NOT Used**
- `-vsync cfr` (already present): Constant frame rate output
- `-copyts`: Would preserve discontinuities (we want correction)
- `-start_at_zero`: Not needed with wallclock timestamps
- `-fflags +genpts`: Regenerate PTS (too aggressive for our case)

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test the fix**: Record a new video and verify sync
2. **Compare before/after**: Keep one old recording to A/B test
3. **Try all modes**: Test screen, webcam, and combo modes
4. **Different durations**: Test 1min, 5min, and 15min recordings
5. **Report results**: If issues persist, note which scenarios have problems

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

**Testing Sync Accurately**:
- Use videos with clear beat markers (claps, drum hits, metronome)
- Record yourself tapping the desk while watching the video
- Count frames between visual and audio cues

**If Audio is Consistently Behind** (not ahead):
Use negative `-itsoffset`:
```rust
cmd.arg("-itsoffset").arg("-0.05")  // Advance audio by 50ms
```

**For Very Long Recordings** (> 1 hour):
Consider adding `-max_muxing_queue_size`:
```rust
cmd.arg("-max_muxing_queue_size").arg("9999")
```
