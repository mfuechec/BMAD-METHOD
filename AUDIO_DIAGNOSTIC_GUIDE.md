# üî¨ Comprehensive Audio Diagnostic Guide

Since audio is still choppy after initial fixes, we need to do a deep-dive analysis to identify the root cause. I've created a complete diagnostic suite to help us pinpoint the exact issue.

---

## üéØ What We've Set Up

### 1. **Enhanced FFmpeg Logging** ‚úÖ
The ClipForge app now logs all FFmpeg output during recording:
- Verbose logging enabled (`-loglevel verbose`)
- Real-time monitoring of audio warnings
- Captures buffer issues, drops, and discontinuities

### 2. **Minimal Test Suite** ‚úÖ
Created `test-audio-minimal.sh` - tests 6 different FFmpeg configurations to isolate the problem:
- Test 1: Absolute minimal (baseline)
- Test 2: + Wallclock timestamps
- Test 3: + Increased buffers
- Test 4: + Aresample filter
- Test 5: Different sample rate (44.1kHz)
- Test 6: Control (no wallclock)

### 3. **Audio Analysis Tool** ‚úÖ
Created `analyze-audio.sh` - analyzes recorded files for:
- Packet timestamp discontinuities
- Audio level issues
- Missing packets
- Silence detection

## üìã Diagnostic Workflow

Follow these steps in order:

### **Phase 1: Run Minimal Test Suite** (Most Important!)

This will tell us which parameter is causing the issue.

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/Gauntlet\ Projects/ClipForge
./test-audio-minimal.sh
```

**What it does:**
1. Tests 6 different recording configurations (10 seconds each)
2. Saves all recordings to `~/Desktop/clipforge-audio-tests/`
3. Each test adds one more parameter

**Your task:**
- Speak continuously during each 10-second test
- After completion, listen to ALL 6 recordings in QuickTime
- Note which ones are choppy vs. smooth

**Report back with:**
```
Test 1 (minimal):      ‚òê Choppy  ‚òê Smooth
Test 2 (wallclock):    ‚òê Choppy  ‚òê Smooth
Test 3 (buffers):      ‚òê Choppy  ‚òê Smooth
Test 4 (aresample):    ‚òê Choppy  ‚òê Smooth
Test 5 (44.1kHz):      ‚òê Choppy  ‚òê Smooth
Test 6 (no wallclock): ‚òê Choppy  ‚òê Smooth
```

---

### **Phase 2: Analyze FFmpeg Logs from ClipForge**

Record a video in ClipForge with the enhanced logging:

1. **Start ClipForge in terminal** (so we can see logs):
   ```bash
   cd ~/Desktop/Gauntlet\ Projects/ClipForge
   npm run tauri:dev
   ```

2. **Record a 30-second video** (speak continuously)

3. **Watch the terminal output** for lines starting with `[FFmpeg Audio]`

4. **Look for these warning signs:**
   - `drop` - packets being dropped
   - `queue full` - buffer overflow
   - `buffer underrun` - buffer empty
   - `discontinuity` - timestamp gaps
   - `overrun` - too much data
   - `pts` issues - timing problems

5. **Copy any warning messages** and share them

---

### **Phase 3: Analyze a Recorded File**

Pick one choppy recording and analyze it:

```bash
./analyze-audio.sh ~/path/to/your/recording.mp4
```

This will show:
- Audio stream details (codec, bitrate, sample rate)
- Timestamp gaps (if any)
- Packet count vs. expected
- Audio level issues

**Share the output** from this analysis.

## üîç What We're Looking For

### Scenario A: All Tests Are Choppy
**Diagnosis**: Fundamental audio device or driver issue
**Likely causes**:
- Audio device configuration problem
- macOS audio system issue
- Hardware problem

**Next steps**:
- Test with different audio input device
- Check System Preferences ‚Üí Sound ‚Üí Input
- Restart Core Audio: `sudo killall coreaudiod`
- Check Console app for system audio errors

---

### Scenario B: Only Tests with Wallclock Are Choppy
**Diagnosis**: `-use_wallclock_as_timestamps` parameter is the culprit
**Likely cause**:
- Audio device clock drift
- Wallclock and device clock mismatch

**Next steps**:
- Remove wallclock parameter
- Use device timestamps instead
- Add manual timing correction

---

### Scenario C: Only Tests with Aresample Are Choppy
**Diagnosis**: `aresample` filter causing issues
**Likely cause**:
- Resampling overhead
- Filter configuration problem

**Next steps**:
- Remove aresample filter
- Try different sync method
- Use simpler audio processing

---

### Scenario D: FFmpeg Logs Show Buffer Issues
**Diagnosis**: Buffer configuration problem
**Likely cause**:
- Buffers too small or too large
- Thread queue configuration
- CPU not keeping up

**Next steps**:
- Adjust buffer sizes
- Reduce encoding complexity
- Check CPU usage during recording

---

### Scenario E: Analysis Shows Timestamp Gaps
**Diagnosis**: Packet capture timing problem
**Likely cause**:
- Device driver issues
- macOS audio capture timing
- Input device buffering

**Next steps**:
- Use different capture method
- Adjust audio device buffer size
- Test with different audio API

---

## üéß Quick Audio Device Check

Before running tests, verify your audio setup:

### List Available Devices
```bash
ffmpeg -f avfoundation -list_devices true -i "" 2>&1 | grep -A 20 "audio devices"
```

### Check System Audio Settings
1. System Preferences ‚Üí Sound ‚Üí Input
2. Select your microphone
3. Verify input level meter moves when you speak
4. Check "Use ambient noise reduction" is OFF (can cause issues)

### Test with System Built-in Mic
If using external mic/interface, try the built-in Mac microphone as a control test.

---

## üìä Expected Results & Interpretations

### If Test 1 (Minimal) is Smooth:
‚úÖ **Good news!** FFmpeg can capture audio properly. The issue is with our added parameters.

‚Üí Run Phase 1 tests and identify which parameter introduces choppiness

### If Test 1 (Minimal) is Choppy:
‚ö†Ô∏è **Fundamental issue** with audio capture on your system.

Possible causes:
1. **Audio device problem**: Try different mic
2. **Sample rate mismatch**: Your device might not support 48kHz
3. **Driver issue**: Check for macOS updates
4. **Core Audio issue**: Restart `coreaudiod`

### If ALL Tests Are Choppy:
‚ùå **System-level audio problem**, not FFmpeg configuration.

Actions:
1. Check Activity Monitor ‚Üí CPU usage during recording
2. Check Console app for audio system errors
3. Test with QuickTime's built-in recorder (as control)
4. Check if other recording apps (Audacity, etc.) have same issue

## üöÄ Quick Start: Run Phase 1 Now

The most important diagnostic is the minimal test suite:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/Gauntlet\ Projects/ClipForge
./test-audio-minimal.sh
```

**This will take ~2 minutes total** (6 tests √ó 10 seconds + gaps)

**Then:**
1. Open `~/Desktop/clipforge-audio-tests/` in Finder
2. Play each MP4 file in QuickTime
3. Note which are choppy
4. Report back with results

---

## üìù Reporting Template

When you run the diagnostics, report back with this info:

```
=== PHASE 1: MINIMAL TEST RESULTS ===
Test 1 (minimal):      [ Choppy / Smooth ]
Test 2 (wallclock):    [ Choppy / Smooth ]
Test 3 (buffers):      [ Choppy / Smooth ]
Test 4 (aresample):    [ Choppy / Smooth ]
Test 5 (44.1kHz):      [ Choppy / Smooth ]
Test 6 (no wallclock): [ Choppy / Smooth ]

=== PHASE 2: FFMPEG LOGS ===
(Paste any [FFmpeg Audio] warning lines here)

=== PHASE 3: FILE ANALYSIS ===
(Paste output from analyze-audio.sh here)

=== SYSTEM INFO ===
Audio input device: (e.g., "Built-in Microphone", "USB Audio Device")
macOS version: (e.g., "Sonoma 14.5")
CPU usage during recording: (check Activity Monitor)
Other apps running: (especially audio apps)
```

---

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Close other audio apps** during testing (Zoom, Spotify, etc.)
2. **Monitor CPU usage** in Activity Monitor while recording
3. **Check Console app** (Applications ‚Üí Utilities ‚Üí Console) for system audio errors
4. **Test built-in mic first** before external audio interfaces
5. **Record in a quiet room** so you can clearly hear choppiness vs. background noise

---

## üîß Quick Fixes to Try First

Before running full diagnostics, try these quick wins:

### Fix 1: Restart Core Audio
```bash
sudo killall coreaudiod
```

### Fix 2: Check Audio MIDI Setup
1. Open "Audio MIDI Setup" app (Spotlight ‚Üí "Audio MIDI")
2. Select your microphone
3. Check sample rate is set to 48000 Hz
4. If not, change it to 48000 Hz

### Fix 3: Test with Built-in Mic
Switch to Mac's built-in microphone and test if issue persists.

### Fix 4: Disable Ambient Noise Reduction
System Preferences ‚Üí Sound ‚Üí Input ‚Üí Uncheck "Use ambient noise reduction"

## üéØ What Happens Next

Based on your diagnostic results, I'll:

1. **Identify the exact problematic parameter**
2. **Remove or replace it** with a working alternative
3. **Test the fix** is targeted and minimal
4. **Ensure sync is maintained** while fixing audio quality

The minimal test suite (Phase 1) is the most critical - it will tell us exactly which parameter is causing the choppy audio.

---

**Ready to run diagnostics?** Start with Phase 1:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/Gauntlet\ Projects/ClipForge
./test-audio-minimal.sh
```

Then report back with which tests are choppy vs. smooth! üî¨
